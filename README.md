# code-refactor

i changed the first div to header at the top as its the main focus of my website "horiseon services"

replaced a few divs with sections instead

replaced divs down at the bottom with aside because those items are on the side of the webpage

put my alt tabs next to the images in case the pictures wouldnt load for some reason there is some text explaining it

changed my title to horiseon services instead of just website

i did try to include a "nav" section at the top where the 3 links are but everytime i would i do that it changed the layout of the page and im not sure why
